## TL;DR

Fitness is an Epic. Small incremental changes, over a sustained period of time, will get you the best results.


## The Basics

- Consider yourself to be the stakeholder & product owner & being fit is your main product

- We're breaking the state of being fit down into three Epics:
  - Diet
  - Excersize
  - Recovery

- Each week is a sprint

- Your velocity will start low and increase as you feel yourself becoming more capable

- Break every goal down into the smallest achievable chunk that can be implemented during a sprint

### Guidelines

(to keep it from sucking)

- For your first sprint, consider your velocity to be very low, maybe just 1 - 3pts

- Do not take on stories that are higher in number than the amount of months you've been on the Agile and Fit method
  - e.g. 1pt the 1st moth, 2pt and 1pt the 2nd month
