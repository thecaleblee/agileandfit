# Agile and Fit

Live longer, like yourself more, and enjoy the time you have more.

## Motivation

Add the already established tapestry of fitness through agile articles with a methodology and examples to help turn the concept into a fitness plan.

## Authors and acknowledgment

This work is built on the shoulders of [giants](https://agilemanifesto.org/authors.html) and would not exist without their method.

No other methods have been consulted, outside of a quick search to see if it was done well enough to not have to do it at all; Any relation to an existing work is coincidental (and I anticipate it will as the method can only be interpreted so many ways).
